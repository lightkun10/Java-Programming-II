Streams are also very handy in handling files. The file is read in
stream form using Java's ready-made Files class. The `lines` method
in the files class allows you to create an input stream from a file,
allowing you to process the rows one by one. The `lines` method gets
a path as its parameter, which is created using the `get` method
in the Paths class. The `get` method is provided a string describing the file path.

The example below reads all the lines in "file.txt" and adds them to the list.
