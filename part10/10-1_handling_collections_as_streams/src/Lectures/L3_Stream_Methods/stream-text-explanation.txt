The figure on stream.png illustrates how a stream works.
- The starting point (1) is a list with values.
- When the stream() method is called on a list,
  (2) a stream of list values ​​is created. The values ​​are
  then dealt with individually.
- The stream values ​​can be (3) filtered by the filter method,
  which removes values ​​that fail to meet the condition from the stream.
- The stream's map method (4) can be used to map values ​​in a stream
  from one form to another.
- The collect method (5) collects the values ​​in a stream into a
  collection provided to it, such as a list.

Underneath is a program of the example depicted in the image
on stream.png.
In this example stream, a new ArrayList list is created to
which values ​​are added.
This is done in the last line .collect(Collectors.toCollection(ArrayList::new));.
