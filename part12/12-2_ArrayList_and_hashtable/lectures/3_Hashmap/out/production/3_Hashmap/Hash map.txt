Hash map is implemented as an array, in which every element includes a list.
The lists contain (key, value) pairs. The user can search from the hash map
based on the key, and they can also add new key-value pairs into it.
Each key can appear at most once in the hash map.

The functioning of the hash map is based on the hash value of the key. When a
new (key, value) pair is stored in a hash map, we calculate a hash value based
on the key to be stored. The hash value decides the index of the internal array
that will be used for storing. The (key, value) pair is stored in the list that
can be found at that index.
