The way of adding to a hash table that was described on part 1 works partly.
The greatest fault in the functionality is that the size of the internal
array is not increased when the number of values grows too large.

Let's add a growing functionality to the program that doubles the size of the
internal array of the hash map. The growing operation should also place each value
in the hash map into the newly created bigger array.
