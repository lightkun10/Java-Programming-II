Going Through A Hash Map's Keys

We may sometimes want to search for a book by a part of its title.
The get method in the hash map is not applicable in this case as
it's used to search by a specific key. Searching by a part of a
book title is not possible with it.

We can go through the values ​​of a hash map by using a for-each
loop on the set returned by the keySet() method of the hash map.

Below, a search is performed for all the books whose names
contain the given string.

==========================================================================
public ArrayList<Book> getBookByPart(String titlePart) {
    titlePart = sanitizedString(titlePart);

    ArrayList<Book> books = new ArrayList<>();

    for(String bookTitle : this.directory.keySet()) {
        if(!bookTitle.contains(titlePart)) {
            continue;
        }

        // if the key contains the given string
        // we retrieve the value related to it
        // and add it tot the set of books to be returned

        books.add(this.directory.get(bookTitle));
    }

    return books;
}
==========================================================================

This way, however, we lose the speed advantage that comes with the
hash map. The hash map is implemented in such a way that searching
by a single key is extremely fast. The example above goes through
all the book titles when looking for the existence of a single book
using a particular key.
