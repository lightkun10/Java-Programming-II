When Should Hash Maps Be Used?
=====================================

Does this mean that we'll only be using hash maps going forward? Of course not.
Hash maps work well when we know exactly what we are looking for. If we wanted
to identify books whose title contains a particular string, the hash map would
be of little use.

The hash maps also have no internal order, and it is not possible to search
the hash map based on the indexes. The items in a list are in the order they
were added to the list.

Typically, hash maps and lists are used together. The hash map provides quick
access to a specific key or keys, while the list is used, for instance, to
maintain order.
