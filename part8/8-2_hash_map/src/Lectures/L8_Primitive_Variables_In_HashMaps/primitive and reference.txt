A hash map's key and the object to be stored are always reference-type variables.
If you want to use a primitive variable as a key or value, there exists a
reference-type version for each one. A few have been introduced below.

Primitive	   Reference-type Equivalent
int	       |       Integer
double	   |       Double
char	   |       Character

Java converts primitive variables to reference-types automatically as they are
added to either a HashMap or an ArrayList. This automatic conversion to a
reference-type variable is termed auto-boxing in Java, i.e. putting something
in a box automatically. The automatic conversion is also possible in the other direction.

=================================================================
int key = 2;
HashMap<Integer, Integer> hashmap = new HashMap<>();
hashmap.put(key, 10);
int value = hashmap.get(key);
System.out.println(value);
=================================================================
Output:
====
10
