Access modifiers private, protected, and public
============================================================================

If a method or variable has the access modifier private, it is visible
only to the internal methods of that class. Subclasses will not see it,
and a subclass has no direct means to access it. So, from the Engine
class there is no way to directly access the variables identifier,
manufacturer, and description, which are defined in the superclass Part.
The programmer cannot access the variables of the superclass that have
been defined with the access modifier private.

A subclass sees everything that is defined with the public modifier
in the superclass. If we want to define some variables or methods
that are visible to the subclasses but invisible to everything else,
we can use the access modifier protected to achieve this.
