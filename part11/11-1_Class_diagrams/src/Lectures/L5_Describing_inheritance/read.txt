In the example from classdiagram-productWarehouseWithHistory.jpg file, the class diagram
describes the classes from the Product warehouse exercise. The ProductWarehouseWithHistory
class inherits the ProductWarehouse class, which, in turn, inherits the Warehouse class.
ChangeHistory is a separate class connected to the ProductWarehouse.
ProductWarehouseWithHistory knows about the ChangeHistory but
the ChangeHistory does not know about the ProductWarehouseWithHistory.


See classdiagram-abstracts.jpg file.
Inheritance of abstract classes is described almost the same way as regular classes.
However we add the description <<abstract>> above the name of the class.
The name of the class and its abstract methods are also written in cursive.
