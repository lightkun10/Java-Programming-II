If there is no arrowhead in a connection, both classes know about each other.
On classdiagram-... file is an example where a book knows about its author
and a person knows about a book they have written.

As you can see, by default — if there is no star on
the connection — the connection is singular.
The classes here are interesting, because a Person can only have one book.

If a person can have multiple books and a book can have multiple authors,
we add a star to both ends of the connection,
